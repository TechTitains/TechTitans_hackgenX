## Project Name: Envira 
### objective:
Develop an AI-powered system for real-time pollution detection. Integrate IoT sensors to monitor air and water quality while enabling automated alerts for authorities and citizens.

### Key features and Modules

### System Modules

#### 1️ User Module
Users can view real-time pollution data through interactive visualizations.
Get instant alerts when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds.
Access AI-powered environmental chatbot for advice and information.
Participate in Vanasaya to adopt and sponsor tree plantations as a step to reduce pollution.

#### 2️ Authority Module
View comprehensive real-time pollution data for their respective areas.
Receive automated advisories when critical pollution levels are detected.
Access historical pollution trends for better decision-making.
Coordinate rapid response actions based on AI predictions.

### * Key Features
#### Vanasaya Program
A unique feature where users can adopt trees.
Contributes directly to reducing pollution levels.
Offers a green certificate or token to adopters.

#### * AI Chatbot
Provides environment-related guidance.
Answers queries about pollution and its impact.
Assists both users and authorities with instant responses.

#### * IoT-Integrated Real-Time Monitoring
IoT sensors capture air and water quality data live.
Data is stored in a MySQL database for analysis and visualization.
Instant alerts and visual dashboards available for both users and authorities.

#### * Smart Alert System
Sends real-time notifications to users when pollution crosses safe limits.
Automatically dispatches advisories to concerned authorities for preventive action.


#### * AI-Powered Prediction
Trained using real-time sensor data to forecast pollution status.
Helps both users and authorities stay proactive about environmental risks.

#### * Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Backend: PHP, Node.js
Database: MySQL
AI Model: Decision Tree 
IoT Integration: Sensor data ingestion and real-time monitoring.

#### Database Used (MySQL)
The below water data  is the fetched data from the sensor and stored to use for prediction
[water_pollution.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19789355/water_pollution.csv)

For Air quality the real time data is stored in the backend and then fetched for predictions.
